# üè• Multimodal Federated Healthcare Diagnostic System (MFDIS)

> A privacy-preserving, multimodal healthcare diagnostic system leveraging federated learning to analyze medical imaging and clinical text data.

## üìå Background & Problem Statement

The healthcare sector faces several critical challenges:

- **Diagnostic Delays**: Doctors face overloaded workloads leading to delayed diagnoses
- **Infrastructure Gap**: Rural and semi-urban regions lack access to advanced diagnostic facilities
- **Data Integration Needs**: Medical diagnosis requires complex integration of:
  - Imaging data (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, ultrasounds)
  - Clinical text (symptoms, history, doctor notes)

### Current Limitations

Existing AI systems are limited by:
- Single modality focus (either image-only OR text-only analysis)
- Hardware bottlenecks in handling massive healthcare datasets
- Data privacy concerns (HIPAA, GDPR, India's DISHA bill compliance)

## üí° Project Concept

This repository implements a sophisticated healthcare diagnostic system that combines medical imaging analysis (X-ray, MRI, CT scans) with clinical text processing (symptoms, patient reports, doctor notes) while maintaining patient privacy through federated learning. The system serves as both a decision-support tool for healthcare professionals and an accessible diagnostic aid for communities in resource-limited regions.

## üéØ Objectives

- Enhance diagnostic accuracy through multimodal input integration
- Ensure patient data privacy using federated learning
- Overcome hardware bottlenecks via distributed training
- Enable accessibility in rural regions
- Support medical professionals with explainable AI reports
